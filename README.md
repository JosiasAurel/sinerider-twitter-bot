# SineRider Twitter bot

This Twitter bot tweets new maths equations from SineRider; a game about love and graphing, every day. It then places you on a leaderboard depending on how you did compared to other people, and gives you an awesome video of your gameplay! SineRider first started as a Unity game back in 2014, and has since grown into a huge open source project that is being built and maintained by teenagers around the globe at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)!
